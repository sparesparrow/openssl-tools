# Workflow Execution Status Update

## Current Status: Workflows Deployed and Queued ‚úÖ

### **Deployed Workflows**

1. **Basic OpenSSL Integration** (openssl-tools)
   - **Status**: Queued (Run ID: 18393967912)
   - **Triggered**: 2+ minutes ago
   - **Purpose**: Actually tests building OpenSSL with Conan
   - **Expected Duration**: 30 minutes when it starts

2. **Fixed Trigger Tools** (openssl)
   - **Status**: Queued (Run ID: 18393970730)
   - **Triggered**: 2+ minutes ago
   - **Purpose**: Tests cross-repository triggering
   - **Expected Duration**: 5 minutes when it starts

### **Why Workflows Are Queued**

GitHub Actions has limited runner availability, and there are currently many workflows running from recent pushes:

- **Multiple CI workflows** from recent commits
- **Fuzz-checker CI**, **Core CI**, **Optimized CI** all running
- **Cross Compile**, **Compiler Zoo CI** queued
- **JFrog Artifactory Integration** pending

This is **normal behavior** for GitHub Actions when there's high activity.

### **What to Expect**

1. **Workflows will start running** when runners become available
2. **Basic OpenSSL Integration** will take ~30 minutes to complete
3. **Fixed Trigger Tools** will take ~5 minutes to complete
4. **Results will be available** in GitHub Actions logs

### **Monitoring Commands**

```bash
# Check Basic OpenSSL Integration status
gh run list --repo sparesparrow/openssl-tools --workflow="Basic OpenSSL Integration" --limit 3

# Check Fixed Trigger Tools status
gh run list --repo sparesparrow/openssl --workflow="Fixed Trigger Tools" --limit 3

# View specific run details
gh run view 18393967912 --repo sparesparrow/openssl-tools
gh run view 18393970730 --repo sparesparrow/openssl
```

### **Expected Outcomes**

#### **Success Scenario**
- ‚úÖ OpenSSL source structure validated
- ‚úÖ conanfile.py compatibility confirmed
- ‚úÖ OpenSSL builds successfully with Conan
- ‚úÖ Cross-repository integration functional

#### **Failure Scenario**
- ‚ùå Build issues identified in conanfile.py
- ‚ùå OpenSSL source compatibility problems
- ‚ùå Conan configuration issues
- üìù Specific error details in logs

### **Next Steps**

1. **Wait for workflows to start** (normal queuing behavior)
2. **Monitor execution** using the commands above
3. **Analyze results** when workflows complete
4. **Fix any issues** found in the build process
5. **Proceed to Phase 2** once basic integration is proven

### **Critical Success Factor**

**The most important thing**: These workflows will **actually test building OpenSSL with the conanfile.py**, which was the missing fundamental piece.

**Once these workflows complete successfully, we'll have proven that the basic OpenSSL + Conan integration works**, which is the foundation for all advanced features.

## Status: ‚úÖ READY FOR EXECUTION

The workflows are properly deployed and queued. They will execute when GitHub Actions runners become available, and we'll have the critical validation of whether OpenSSL + Conan integration actually works.
