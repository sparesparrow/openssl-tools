## Migration Guide

### From Manual Setup to OpenSSL Tools

1. **Python Environments**: Replace manual venv setup with `setup_python_env.py`
2. **Conan Configuration**: Use `conan_remote_manager.py` for GitHub Packages setup
3. **Build Optimization**: Integrate `build_optimizer.py` for caching
4. **Package Signing**: Implement `package_signer.py` for security
5. **Fuzzing**: Set up `fuzz_integration.py` for automated testing

### Configuration Migration

#### Before (Manual)
```bash
# Manual Python environment setup
python3.11 -m venv ~/.venvs/openssl-py311
source ~/.venvs/openssl-py311/bin/activate
pip install conan requests cryptography

# Manual Conan setup
conan remote add github-packages https://nuget.pkg.github.com/sparesparrow/index.json
conan remote login github-packages username token

# Manual build process
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

#### After (OpenSSL Tools)
```bash
# Automated setup
python setup_python_env.py --versions 3.11
python conan_remote_manager.py --setup
python build_optimizer.py --stats
python package_signer.py --generate-key
python fuzz_integration.py --setup
```
